    <h1>Add BIM Data Dictionary Semantics</h1>

    <p>This plugin can be used to add a class and additional attributes to features by editing the attribute table in QGIS.</p>
    <p>To classify features, a data dictionary API can be queried to retrieve classes and associated attributes from a specific data dictionary.</p>
    <p>The plugin is implemented against the buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bsDD), but any data dictionary that follows this API structure can be queried.</p>

    <p>If attributes exist, you can assign values to them before adding them to features.</p>
    <p>You can select only some features or classify all features in the layer with the same class and attributes.</p>
